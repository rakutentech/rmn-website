Rakuten Mindfulness Network (RMN) is an company supported employee-driven community established in July 2017 that aspires to uplift work and life of Rakutenians through mindfulness-based approaches . Employees who volunteer their time and talent to achieve this goal are the RMN Core Members. 

The Core Members are mindfulness practitioners who have benefited from their experiences of mindfulness practice. Their involvement with RMN is based on mindfulness1, compassion2, and joy3 to create a better workplace at Rakuten.

Therefore, RMN activities are an opportunity for the Core Members to apply and improve their mindfulness practices. Through core-member activities, we practice what we promote as RMN.
